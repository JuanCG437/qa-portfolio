# üèõÔ∏è Test Strategic

A test strategy is a high-level document that outlines the overall approach and guiding principles for software testing, ensuring efficient and effective testing processes.

## What is Test Strategy?
A **test strategy** is a formal document that defines the testing approach for a project. It serves as a blueprint for the testing process, detailing how testing will be conducted to ensure quality of the software product.
The strategy encompasses various aspects, incluiding the scope of testing, testing objectives, methodologies, and resource allocation.

## key Components of a Test Strategy
1. **Scope and Overview: This section outlines what will be tested and why providing a clear undestanding of the application uder test (AUT).
2. **Test Approach**: Defines the specific methods and techniques that will be used during testing, incluiding manual and automated testing strategies.
3. **Test Levels**: Lists the different levels of testing that will be performed, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
4. **Roles and Responsabilities**: Clarifies the roles of team members involved in the testing process, ensuring accountability and clear communication.
5. **Testing environment**: Specifies the requirements for the testing environment, incluiding hardware, software, and network configurations necessary for testing.
6. **Risk Management**: Identifies potential risks associated with testing process and outlines strategies for mitigating these risks.
7. **Testing tools**: Lists the tools and technologies that will be used for testing, incluiding automation tools, test management software, and defect tracking systems.

## Importance of a Test Strategy
- **Guidance**: Provides a structured framework that directs the testing team on how to efficiently conduct test, ensuring all key aspects of the software are validated.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies and addresses critical risks early in the testing process, reducing the likelihood of defects in the final product.
- **Resource Optimization**: Streamlines processes and optimizies the use of resources and timelines, enhancing overall project efficiency.
- **Team Alignment**: Promotes teamwork by aligning all members with project goals and ensuring everyone understands their responsabilities.

## Types of Test Strategies
1. **Static vs Dynamic Testing**: Static testing involves reviewing code and documents without execution, while dynamic testing runs the software to check behavior in real scenarios.
2. **Preventive vs Reactive Testing**: This strategy balances preventing defecys before they occur and reacting to unexpected issues after deployment.
3. **Hybrid Strategy**: Combines manual and automated testing approached to leverage the strgengths of both methods.

## Differences Between Test Strategy vs Test Approach

| **Aspect**  | **Test Strategy**             | **Test Approach**        |
|------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Scope      | Organization or program level  | Project/release level    |
| Nature     | High-level, static             | Detailed, dynamic        |
| Focus      | What and why                   | How, when, and who       |
| Ownership  | Test managers, QA leaders      | Test leads, QA Engineers |
| Example    | "We automate regression tests" | "We use Selenium automate login and checkout regression test"|

>In simple words:
>- **Test Strategy** = the "what & why" at a high level.
>- **Test Approach** = the "how & who" in a specific project.
