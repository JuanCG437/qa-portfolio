# 🐞 Bug Life Cycle (Defect Life Cycle)
The **Bug Life Cycle** (or Defect Life Cycle) is the set of stages a defect goes through from the moment it is discovered until it is closed. It helps teams track and manage issues efficiently.

## Typical Bug Life Cycle Stages:
**1. New** -> Bug is reported and logged.
**2. Assigned** -> The bug is assigned to a developer.
**3. Developing** -> Developer work in the solution.
**4. Fixed** -> Change is made in code for solution.
**5. Transfer to QA** -> Developer checking the change and it transfer to QA Analyst.
**6. Test Execution / Retest** -> QA Analyst checks if defect was fixed.
**7. Checked** -> If there are no defects, it is approved.
**8. Closed** -> If the bug no longer occurs, QA closes it.
**9. Reopened** -> If the bug persists after the fix, it is reopened.
**10. Deferred / Rejected** -> Sometimes bugs are postponed (low priority) or rejected (not valid).
